# Google Search Automation with Selenium

This project demonstrates how to use Selenium with Python to perform automated tasks on Google. Specifically, it searches for "QA Automation Tools" and retrieves the top 10 tools from the search results. Additionally, it navigates to the News tab to display titles of news articles published within the last 3 months.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The programming language used to write the automation scripts.
- **Selenium**: A tool for automating web browsers, used here to interact with Google and scrape search results.
- **Chrome WebDriver**: Selenium's WebDriver for controlling Google Chrome.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You will also need to install the necessary Python libraries.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv selenium-env
    source selenium-env/bin/activate
    ```

3. **Install required Python packages**:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    The `requirements.txt` file should include:

    ```
    selenium
    ```

4. **Download ChromeDriver**: Ensure you have the ChromeDriver executable compatible with your version of Google Chrome. Place it in a directory included in your system's PATH or specify its location in the script.

### Usage

1. **Run the main script**:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

    This will perform the following tasks:

    - Search for "QA Automation Tools" on Google.
    - Print the top 10 recommended tools based on the search results.
    - Click on the News tab and print the titles of news articles published in the last 3 months.

## Solutions Provided

- **Search Task**: The script performs a Google search for "QA Automation Tools", extracts the top 10 tools from the search results, and displays them.
- **News Headlines**: The script navigates to the News tab and retrieves headlines of articles published in the last 3 months.

## Possible Improvements

- **Error Handling**: Add more robust error handling to manage scenarios where elements are not found or the page structure changes.
- **Dynamic Waits**: Implement WebDriverWait for more reliable element interactions instead of using static sleep times.
- **Data Storage**: Save the extracted data (tools and news headlines) to a file (e.g., CSV or JSON) for later analysis.
- **User Input**: Allow users to specify search keywords and date ranges dynamically via command-line arguments or configuration files.
- **Headless Mode**: Run the browser in headless mode for better performance and less resource consumption, especially on CI/CD systems.
